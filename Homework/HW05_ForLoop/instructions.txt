    In the Python editor IDLE, create and save a Python file that is named, if your name is 
    Harry Houdini, for example, py and begins with a comment containing your name, class and section, 
    the posting date and number of the homework assignment.

Write a program that implements the following exercises:

    Create a list named months of the months of the year. Write a for loop that iterates over the 
    elements of months and prints out each one that begins with letter 'J', one month per line.

Write a for loop that iterates over all of the integers in the range 0 through 99, inclusive, 
and prints out all of those numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 5.
    
Consider the strings created by these assignment statements:

    horton = "A person's a person, no matter how small."
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    Write a for loop that prints out all the vowels in horton in the order they appear.
