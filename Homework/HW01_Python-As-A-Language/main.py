1.1 -------------------
1) The program throws an unmatched ')' error. When both are not present, the program throws a syntax error.
2) The program thinks that the code is trying to print a variable that does not exist.
3) The number just displays like normal. When 2 pluses are used, the program simply ignores one of them and 
completes the operation.
4) The program throws an error, saying that leading zeroes are not permitted.
5) The program just prints both values, but does nothing to them. (22 just prints the number 22)

1.2 -------------------
1) 2562 seconds.
2) Approximately 6.2 miles.
3) 6 minutes 52 seconds per mile. 8.72 miles per hour.

2.1 -------------------
1) 42 = n is not legal as it is assigning a variable to a number, which is not allowed.
2) x = y = 1 is legal, as it will assign 1 to y and then y to x. So they will all equal to 1.
3) The program ignores it, but it still highlights it red in the editor.
4) The program expects an attribute that is absent.
5) The program will think that xy is a variable, and say it is not defined.

2.2 -------------------
1) 523.6 cubed units. 
2) $945.45 
3) 7:30 AM <-- I didn't understand this question, so I'm assuming I just add all of the times mentioned.
