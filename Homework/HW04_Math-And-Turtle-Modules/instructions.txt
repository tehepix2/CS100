Read the first section of Chapter 4 (Case Study: Interface Design): “The turtle module” 
in the textbook.
In the Python editor IDLE, create and save a Python file that is named, if your name is 
Harry Houdini, for example, py and begins with a comment containing your name, class and 
section, the posting date and number of the homework assignment. Use either a block comment 
or one-line comment style. Example:
"""
Harry Houdini
CS 100 2018S Section 004
HW 03, January 29, 2018
"""
or
# Harry Houdini
# CS 100 2018S Section 004
# HW 03, January 29, 2018

 

Write code that uses turtle graphics to draw an equilateral triangle, a square and a 
regular pentagon, each with side length 100.
Write code that uses turtle graphics to draw four concentric circles of radius 50, 100, 150 and 200.
Write code that uses the Python math module to compute and print out the values of
    100!
    the log (base 2) of 1,000,000
    the greatest common divisor of 63 and 49

Write a program that asks the user for a color, a line width, a line length and a shape. 
Assume that the user will specify a shape that is either a line, a triangle, or a square. 
Use turtle graphics to draw the shape that the user requests of the size, color, line width 
and line length that the user requests. For example, if these are the user choices for 
color, width, line length and shape, the blue triangle below would be correct graphical output

what color? blue
what line width? 25
what line length? 100
line, triangle or square? triangle

Hint

There is a description of each function in the math module in the Python documentation, 
which you can access through IDLE from the Help menu as follows:
