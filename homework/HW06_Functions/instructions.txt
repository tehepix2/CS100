    In the Python editor IDLE, create and save a Python file that is named, if your 
    name is Harry Houdini, for example, py and begins with a comment containing your 
    name, class and section, the posting date and number of the homework assignment.

 

1. Problem 1

    Write a function named hasFinalLetter that takes two parameters

            strList, a list of non-empty strings
            letters, a string of upper and/or lower case letters

     The function hasFinalLetter should create and return a list of all the strings 
     in strList that end with a letter in letters.

    Create three test cases, each consisting of a list of non-empty strings and a 
    string of upper and/or lower case letters, for your function. One of these tests 
    should return the empty list. For each test case write two assignment statements 
    and a function call that pass the test arguments to your function.

2. Problem 2

    Write a function named isDivisible that takes two parameters
        maxInt, an integer
        twoInts, a tuple of two integers

    The function isDivisible should create and return a list of all the integerss in 
    the range from 1 to maxInt (not including maxInt) that are divisible of both ints in 
    twoInts.

    Create three test cases, each consisting of a value for maxInt and a value for twoInts, 
    for your function. One of these tests should return the empty list. For each test case 
    write two assignment statements and a function call that pass the test arguments to your function.
